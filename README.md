# DoesItHaveAFive
Tells you whether or not the temperature has a 5 in it. Automatically updates every minute.

There are lots of things to clean up, and even a feature or two to add:
  - Cleanup CSS: Lot's of the CSS here is pretty gross and hacky
  - Cleanup file reading and content-type header determination
  - Add expertmode and simple mode functionality
  - Add caching of temperature every minute to server

Potentially down the road I could also use the location of the client, but I'm not sure if that's something I want to spend my time with.
